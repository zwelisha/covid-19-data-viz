# COVID-19 Data Visualisation
Live Project: [View Dashboard](https://covid-19-data-viz.onrender.com)
## Description
- Visualise the supplied data in a graph of some sort programmatically.
- You may use any tools or languages that you would like (please do not use Excel).
- When submitting your code, please provide a detailed explanation of how your code works.
- Also, please detail any external libraries that may be required for your code to work

## Getting Started

### Requirements

1. Python 3
2. Pip 
3. Text editor (Recommended: VSCode or SublimeText or Atom)
4. Dash
5. Black
   
### Installation

#### 1. Python 3

The installation differs from one operating system to the other, but the documentation which can be found [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) have clear instructions for each operating system.

#### 2. Pip

pip is the package installer for Python. 
Details [here](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)

#### 3. Text Editor
Any text editor of your choice can be used. However Visual Studio Code and Atom are highly recommended. See [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Atom](https://atom-editor.cc/)

#### 4. Dash
Run ```pip install dash```

#### 5. Black
I use Black to format the code to conform to PEP 8 standard.
```pip install black```

#### Folder Structure

There is one folder in this project with every file needed to run the code.

```.gitignore
    app.py
    covid.json
    README.md
    requirements.txt
```

### Formatting The Code

Use Black for consistency
Run ```black app.py``` to format the code after making changes.

### Running The Project
Run ```python app.y```
Then click on the link to see the output or copy and paste the link on your browser.

#### 1. Clone the project
```
git clone https://github.com/zwelisha/covid-19-data-viz.git
```

#### 2. Change Directory (To the root folder of the project)

Change directory to the project `cd covid-19-data-viz`.
There you will see the folder structure detailed above.

Then to run this app run the following command

```
python app.py
```

### Testing the code
There are no tests yet, but I prefer pytest.

Have fun
